# SMT MIG 2024

This repository contains material from the [Society of Music Theory](https://societymusictheory.org/)'s **Music Informatics Interest Group** (MIIG) meeting, at our 2024 [national conference](https://societymusictheory.org/meetings/smt-2024) in Jacksonville, Florida.

The materials include two presentation/workshops related to methodological concerns in computational music theory:

+ *Representing Musical Objects as Data*
  + Nat Condit-Schultz
  + [Computational and Cognitive Musicology Lab](https://ccml.gtcmt.gatech.edu)
  + Georgia Tech, [School of Music](https://music.gatech.edu)
+ *Representetive Sampling of Music*
  + Nick Shea (*MIIG Chair*)
  + [CACTUS Music Lab](https://www.cactusmusiclab.com/)
  + Arizona State University, [School of Music, Dance and Theatre](https://musicdancetheatre.asu.edu/)


This repo can be accessed and played with in this posit cloud "sandbox" environment.

### Data

Several [humdrum](humdrum.org)-formatted datasets are included in the repo:

+ `**kern` encodings of 371 Chorales by J.S. Bach.
+ The [CoCoPops](https://github.com/Computational-Cognitive-Musicology-Lab/CoCoPops) dataset of 20th-century rock/pop transcriptions.


### Software


In Nat's presentation, I will use [humdrumR](https://humdrumr.ccml.gtcmt.gatech.edu/): an R-package for computational musicology.
