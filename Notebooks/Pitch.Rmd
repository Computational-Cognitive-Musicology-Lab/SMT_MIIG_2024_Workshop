# Representing Pitch

```{r}
library(humdrumR)

```

We will start with some simple data, the 371 Bach Chorales:

```{r}

bach <- readHumdrum('../Data/Bach371/.*krn')

```

```{r}
bach
```

In this data, the pitches are represented as `**kern` format, which is essentially the same a "Scientific Pitch Notation." We can even convert to scientific notation using the `pitch()` function:

```{r}
bach |> pitch()
```

There are three pieces of information:

-   Scale step (A-G)

-   Accidental (#, b, bb, etc.)

-   Octave
