# Welcome!

We have two presentations planned:

+ Exploring Pitch information using humdrum$_{\mathbb{R}}$
  + --- Nat
+ Sample representation in the Rolling Stone. 
  + --- Nick


----

We will be using this Posit Cloud sandbox environment.

# Humdrum


----


Humdrum is a system for computational musicology created by David Huron, circa 1989--1995.

+ The humdrum ecosystem includes:
  + A data format
    + The "*humdrum syntax*"
  + Software
    + The original *humdrum toolkit* 
    + Craig Sapp's *Verovio Humdrum Viewer*
    + My humdrum$_{\mathbb{R}}$



## The Humdrum Syntax


The humdrum "syntax" is a simple tabular format, emphasizing transparency (read/write ease) and musicological flexibility.

+ Lots of musical information can be represented.
+ The standard representation for conventional notation is called `**kern`.

---


```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, results = 'asis'}
txt <- readLines('M179.txt')

# txt <- paste0('!!!filter:%20extract%20-s%201-4,0%0A', txt)

str <- tags$div(class = 'notes', tags$iframe(src = paste0('https://verovio.humdrum.org/?k=E&t=', txt), width = '1600px', height = '2000px', title="Verovio Humdrum Viewer"))
str
```

---

Tens of thousands of `**kern` scores are available.

+ Possible to include *any* arbitrary information
  + Harmonic information
  + Formal information
  + Dance steps, emotion annotations, fingerings, 
  + etc.


## humdrumR

Humdrum$_{\mathbb{R}}$ is a new, R-based, software for analyzing humdrum data.

+ Enhanced functionality compared to the original humdrum toolkit.



# Representing Music

## Music as Data

A music encoding is a representation of musical events (notes, chords) or structures (meter, tonality).

+ No encoding is perfect.
  + Encodings are at best imperfect measurements of "real" structures.
+ There are many ways we can represent musical information.
  + Different approaches reveal different information.

----

Today we'll use humdrum$_{\mathbb{R}}$ to explore and discuss basic questions about pitch data.

+ I'll draw on three datasets:
  + The 371 Bach chorales
  + The CoCoPops corpus of rock/pop vocal transcriptions
  + The Saraga dataset of Hindustani performances.
  
----


Discussion items:

+ Concerning pitch representation
+ Concerning methodology
+ Concerning pedagogy
